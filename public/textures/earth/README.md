# Earth Texture Assets

Add the exported NASA/Natural Earth textures here using the following file names:

- `earth-base.png` – greyscale diffuse map with borders and meridians.
- `earth-bump.png` – smooth height/bump map for subtle relief.
- `earth-specular.png` – low-intensity specular/roughness mask.
- `earth-lights.png` (optional) – dim night-lights emissive map.

Files should be 4096×2048 PNG (or higher). The R3F globe material will gracefully fall back to a flat grey sphere if any asset is missing.
